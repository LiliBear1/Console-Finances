## Process

* I used a [spreadsheet](/Console-Finances/images/Number-check.png) to manually check my numbers 

* REQ 1 was a simple use of the length property

* I then had to arrange this into the correct layout using quotations, concatonates and line breaks

* REQ 2 was not as simple as I initially thought, my spreadsheet was helpful here because I could see the result I was getting was incorrect

* I looked into "maps" and used this to create the profit array

* This was then fed into a for loop to get a sum

* REQ 3 - I used the reduce function to get the average

* REQ 4 & 5 - I looked into "forEach" to get the max and min months with the relevant amounts

## Additional notes

* I am aware I didn't quite get the answer of changes in P&L right (REQ 3) which impacted the results for max and min month (REQ 4 & 5), I couldn't work this one out so will ask the class / TAs about this. 

Either way, I think the right methodology was used in getting the profit array and calculating a general average otherwise.
